<h2> FACTS ABOUT NATURE</h2>
<p>Nature, with its diverse and fascinating elements, holds numerous intriguing facts that showcase its beauty and
    complexity:
    <br>
    1. **Biodiversity:** Earth is home to an estimated 8.7 million species, ranging from microscopic bacteria to giant
    whales, each playing a unique role in the ecosystem.
    <br>
    2. **Photosynthesis:** Plants engage in photosynthesis, a process where they convert sunlight into energy, producing
    oxygen as a byproduct. This process sustains almost all life forms on Earth.
    <br>
    3. **Water World:** About 71% of the Earth's surface is covered in water, with oceans holding approximately 97% of
    the planetâ€™s water.
    <br>
    4. **Amazon Rainforest:** Often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth," the Amazon Rainforest produces 20% of the
    world's oxygen supply.
    <br>
    5. **The Great Barrier Reef:** Visible from space, the Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on Earth,
    stretching over 2,300 kilometers and comprising thousands of individual reefs and islands.
    <br>
    6. **Migration Marvels:** Many species, from birds to butterflies and whales, undertake incredible migratory
    journeys, traveling thousands of miles annually.
    <br>
    7. **Oldest Living Organism:** Methuselah, a bristlecone pine tree in California, is over 4,800 years old, making it
    one of the oldest known living organisms on Earth.
    <br>
    8. **Rainbows:** Rainbows are formed by the reflection, refraction, and dispersion of light in water droplets,
    creating a stunning spectrum of colors in the sky.
    <br>
    9. **Tidal Energy:** The gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun creates tides, a powerful and renewable source
    of energy harnessed by some coastal regions.
    <br>
    10. **Eternal Ice:** Antarctica contains about 60% of the world's fresh water in the form of ice, and some ice cores
    drilled from Antarctica reveal information about Earth's climate history.
    <br>
    11. **Venomous Plants:** While many animals are venomous, some plants, like the stinging nettle, have specialized
    cells that inject toxins when touched.
    <br>
    12. **The Dead Sea:** The Dead Sea is the saltiest body of water on Earth, so dense that people can float
    effortlessly on its surface.
    <br>
    chemical reactions, creating a magical glow in the ocean depths.
    <br>
    14. **Natural Recyclers:** Decomposers like fungi and bacteria break down organic matter, recycling nutrients back
    into the ecosystem.
    <br>
    15. **Migration of Monarchs:** Monarch butterflies undertake an incredible migration, traveling up to 4,800
    kilometers from Canada and the United States to Mexico for the winter.
